# Neural-Machine-Translation
Neural Machine Translation using deep transfer learning from pre-trained transformer based model. 
Neural machine translation (NMT) is a type of machine learning technique used for
automatically translating text from one language to another with the help of deep Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs). With the advancement in computational resources and Deep Learning, many NMT models have been trained and developed from huge datasets and have shown remarkable translation accuracy. However, since the domain of Natural Language Understanding is very ambiguous there are still numerous loopholes that those models cannot fill. Some of those are translating (i) Out Of Vocabulary(OOV) words, (ii) slang and poetic expressions, and (iii) understanding the contextual and semantic meaning of the sentences across various levels of formality and cultural references. 
Our model introduces those issues by using an ensemble of pre-trained state-of-the-art Natural Language Understanding Transformer model t5-small which are tuned on different datasets of a language pair with the help of Deep Transfer Learning. Tuning those models on different datasets (language pair dataset, subtitle dataset) improves those modelsâ€™ performance in translating OOV words as well as in understanding the semantic meaning of the sentences.
